Friends and Candies","contestId":"1538","problemIndex":"B","timeLimit":"2 seconds","memLimit":"256 megabytes","inputFormat":"standard input","outputFormat":"standard output","problemHtml":"<p>Polycarp has $$$n$$$ friends, the $$$i$$$-th of his friends has $$$a_i$$$ candies. Polycarp&apos;s friends do not like when they have different numbers of candies. In other words they want all $$$a_i$$$ to be the same. To solve this, Polycarp performs the following set of actions exactly <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">once</span>: </p><ul> <li> Polycarp chooses $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\le k \\le n$$$) arbitrary friends (let&apos;s say he chooses friends with indices $$$i_1, i_2, \\ldots, i_k$$$); </li><li> Polycarp distributes their $$$a_{i_1} + a_{i_2} + \\ldots + a_{i_k}$$$ candies among all $$$n$$$ friends. During distribution for each of $$$a_{i_1} + a_{i_2} + \\ldots + a_{i_k}$$$ candies he chooses new owner. That can be any of $$$n$$$ friends. Note, that any candy can be given to the person, who has owned that candy before the distribution process. </li></ul><p>Note that the number $$$k$$$ is not fixed in advance and can be arbitrary. Your task is to find the minimum value of $$$k$$$.</p><p>For example, if $$$n=4$$$ and $$$a=[4, 5, 2, 5]$$$, then Polycarp could make the following distribution of the candies: </p><ul> <li> Polycarp chooses $$$k=2$$$ friends with indices $$$i=[2, 4]$$$ and distributes $$$a_2 + a_4 = 10$$$ candies to make $$$a=[4, 4, 4, 4]$$$ (two candies go to person $$$3$$$). </li></ul><p>Note that in this example Polycarp cannot choose $$$k=1$$$ friend so that he can redistribute candies so that in the end all $$$a_i$$$ are equal.</p><p>For the data $$$n$$$ and $$$a$$$, determine the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">minimum</span> value $$$k$$$. With this value $$$k$$$, Polycarp should be able to select $$$k$$$ friends and redistribute their candies so that everyone will end up with the same number of candies.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$).
